What is Markdown:
Markdown (often abbreviated as "md") is a lightweight markup language designed to make it easy to format text using plain-text syntax that can be converted into HTML for the web. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is simple to write and read, making it popular for documentation, blogs, README files, and note-taking.

1. Headers:
Headers are created by adding # symbols before text. The number of # symbols indicates the header level (like HTML's <h1>, <h2>, etc.).
Example:
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3


2. Emphasis:
Markdown supports bold and italic text.
To make text bold, wrap it in **double asterisks** or __double underscores__.
To make text italic, wrap it in *single asterisks* or _single underscores_.
Example:
**Bold text**
*Italic text*


3. Lists:
Markdown supports both ordered (numbered) and unordered (bulleted) lists.
Unordered List: Use -, +, or * to create bullet points.
Unordered Example:
- Item 1
- Item 2
Ordered Example:
1. First item
2. Second item


4. Links:
To add a hyperlink, use the format [text](URL).
Example:
[OpenAI](https://openai.com)


5. Images:
Images use the same syntax as links but with an exclamation mark ! in front.
Example:
![Alt text](image_url.jpg)


6. Blockquotes:
To create a blockquote (quoted text), use > at the beginning of the line.
Example:
> This is a blockquote.


7. Code:
Markdown has different ways to format code:
Inline code: Use backticks ` for inline code snippets.
Example:
Inline `code snippet`


8. Horizontal Rule:
You can create a horizontal line using three or more dashes ---, asterisks ***, or underscores ___.
Example:
---


9. Tables:
Markdown tables use pipes | to separate columns, and dashes - to create header cells.
Example:
| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Row 1    | Data     |
| Row 2    | More Data|


10. Checkboxes (for Task Lists)
To create checkboxes, use - [ ] for an empty checkbox and - [x] for a checked box.
Example:
- [x] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
